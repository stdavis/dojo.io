Dojo 2 is the most substantial rethink to the Dojo Toolkit in ten years. As it nears Beta status for the majority of its modules, quite a bit has changed these past few months as it has evolved into a powerful solution for building enterprise applications.

## A new generation

Dojo 2 is a next generation framework authored to emphasize:

* Efficiency.  Code structure and developer ergonomics have been challenged at every turn resulting in impeccable code quality.

* Longevity.  Sustainable code that will last and adapt as the platform changes is a key consideration for large-scale development projects.

* Modularity.  Designed as a collection of packages that may be used independently or cooperatively, allowing for development flexibility.

* Focus. The focus is enterprise-driven, highlighting scalability as well as powerful, built-in features including support for large data sets, a11y and i18n. 

## The Tenets of Dojo 2

#### Common Patterns & Standards
Dojo 2 strives for an efficient development approach through common patterns and best practices. Refined APIs and consistent paradigms lead to a robust, forward thinking approach.

#### Quality

Dojo 2 focuses on quality, with exhaustive test suites and comprehensive code coverage.  The deliberate architecture joined with a purposeful combination of tools and technology creates a smooth approach to building modern web applications.

#### ES6+

With a foundation on ES6+ and its annual release cycle, we begin with a solid base feature set and a strategic approach to shimming future features. 

#### TypeScript

TypeScript extends ES6+ to support development time types and interfaces, leading to first-class IDE support and powerful tools for understanding your code. Dojo 2 leverages TypeScript's quarterly updates to help teams deliver code with clearer intent.

### Reactivity

Dojo 2 embraces functional reactive programming concepts, which have come a long way since Dojo 1’s early get/set methods and virtual scrolling grids. Dojo 2 supports a unidirectional data flow approach, where one can easily react to and/or observe changes to data.

And much more...

### Simple OOTB

Dojo 2 was conceptualized with the guiding principle that a developer could have a build up and running in seconds and modifying and deploying real apps in minutes. 

### Widgets

The Dojo 2 UI widget system provides a system for building Reactive, TypeScript Web Components. It leverages a Virtual DOM and HyperScript over templates or JSX and raw CSS and css-next over traditional preprocessors.

Its widget-scoped CSS classes and autocomplete make it easy to discover those classes for use within our widget code. It also provides a suite of out of the box widgets which are easily extensible including dgrid, charts and more.

### Roadmap

The Dojo 2 roadmap highlights many of the details, but at a high level Dojo 2 will be released in mid-2017 following 3 Beta releases and and a release candidate phase.

### Community

Though positioned to meet the needs of the enterprise, at its core, Dojo 2 will be focused on building a healthy open-source community that promotes growth, best practices and code stewardship to its users in an environment that embraces respect and inclusivity.   Learn how you and your organization can become part of this community today.

### Evaluate

Dojo 2’s Beta 1 release is intentional and focused.  We welcome you to explore through review of its architectural design, Github, and the initial tutorials.
